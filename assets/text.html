  <p>Have you the mettle to play my game, <br />
  With shooting fire and roaring flame?  <br />
  Or are you cowards, yellow bellies, <br />
  Stomachs weak, and knees of jelly?
  </p>


  <h2>Intro/Callout</h2>

  <p>
  O Denizens of BRC <br />
  A fiery challenge waits for thee, <br />
  A heated du’el fought with flame <br />
  If ye’ve the mettle for our game.  <br />
  Two players enter to the field <br />
  Of battle, there with gloves to wield <br />
  With jab, with hook, with sonic booms, <br />
  The champions grapple to their dooms.  <br />
  The victors leave the field elated, <br />
  Losers, beaten, are cremated.  <br />
  Win my love or draw my ire...  <br />
  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Super Street Fire!!!
  </p>


  <h2>Rules</h2>

  <p>
  In order to participate <br />
  Round one begins when we call “FIGHT!!” <br />
